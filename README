This version has been modified to work on Mac OSX (Specifically tested on 10.6.7)

The scons build tool was replaced with GNU make to reduce the size of the repo, and to remove the dependency on Python.

For the original library, and other ports including the original Java library, see: http://code.google.com/p/zxing

To install:

make && make install

To test:
./bin/qrdecode ~/qrcode.png
